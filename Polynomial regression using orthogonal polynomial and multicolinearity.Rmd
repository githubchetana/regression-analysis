Observe the scatter plot of the above data. fit the second order polynomial the express the avg annual cost as a function of recorder quantity.Use orthogonal polynomial to fit the model.Is there evidence that quadratic term is statistically significant?comment on need the quadratic term in the model.
```{r}
x=c(50,75,100,125,150,175,200,225,250,275);x;
y=c(335,326,316,313,311,314,318,328,337,345);y;
plot(x,y)
model_1=lm(y~x+I(x^2))
summary(model_1)
Model_2=lm(y~poly(x,2))
Model_2
summary(Model_2)
